/**
 * Demonstrates a simple use of Ignite with [[ComputeTaskSplitAdapter]].
 * <p>
 * Phrase passed as task argument is split into jobs each taking one word. Then jobs are distributed among
 * cluster nodes. Each node computes word length and returns result to master node where total phrase length
 * is calculated on reduce stage.
 * <p>
 * Remote nodes should always be started with special configuration file which
 * enables P2P class loading: `'ignite.{sh|bat} examples/config/example-ignite.xml'`.
 * <p>
 * Alternatively you can run [[ExampleNodeStartup]] in another JVM which will start node
 * with `examples/config/example-ignite.xml` configuration.
