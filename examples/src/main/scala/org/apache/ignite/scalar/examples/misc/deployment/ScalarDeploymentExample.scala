/**
 * Demonstrates how to explicitly deploy a task. Note that
 * it is very rare when you would need such functionality as tasks are
 * auto-deployed on demand first time you execute them. So in most cases
 * you would just apply any of the `Ignite.execute(...)` methods directly.
 * However, sometimes a task is not in local class path, so you may not even
 * know the code it will execute, but you still need to execute it. For example,
 * you have two independent components in the system, and one loads the task
 * classes from some external source and deploys it; then another component
 * can execute it just knowing the name of the task.
 * <p>
 * Also note that for simplicity of the example, the task we execute is
 * in system classpath, so even in this case the deployment step is unnecessary.
 * <p>
 * Remote nodes should always be started with special configuration file which
 * enables P2P class loading: `'ignite.{sh|bat} examples/config/example-ignite.xml'`.
 * <p>
 * Alternatively you can run [[ExampleNodeStartup]] in another JVM which will
 * start node with `examples/config/example-ignite.xml` configuration.
